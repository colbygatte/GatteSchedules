## gatteSchedules

Gatte Schedules is an employee scheduling app capable of managing multiple shifts and positions. 

## Motivation

For the past 9 years, I have worked in a small restaurant. All of our schedules are done by hand with paper and pencil. For my final project at The Iron Yard, I decided to make an employee scheduling app for iOS.
