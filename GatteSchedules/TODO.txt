1) Schedule Editor

Should permissions be an enum instead of a string?
Use enum for defining the begin and end times on shifts
Need to be able to delete shifts
Add progress circles when loading is happening


In ScheduleEditor, filter the users down to only the ones who can work a position

# reading a file
let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "TODO", ofType: "txt")
var text = try! String(contentsOfFile: path!, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)

eventually implement a scroll view instead of just a moving view
